    <h2>Mimikyu's True Form</h2>
    <p><strong>Intro:</strong> One of the creepiest modern Pokémon, Mimikyu’s true form is purposely hidden—its costume is a disguise to avoid harming those who see what it really is.</p>
    <h3>Canonical Description</h3>
    <p>Pokédex entries say: “When people see its actual body, it suffers a mysterious illness or death.” Researchers who have heard its cries reportedly died shortly after.</p>
    <h3>Fan Theories</h3>
    <p>Theories include it being an undead child, a failed clone, or distorted Pokémon experiment. Its curse-like traits have sparked speculative fiction and fan gyms.</p>
    <h3>Appearances</h3>
    <p>Featured as a Totem Pokémon in Sun & Moon, it uses a Z-Move called “Let’s Snuggle Forever.” Its crying voice and sadness-themed lore made it a standout character.</p>
    <h3>Legacy</h3>
    <p>Mimikyu inspired a “Pokémon Mimikyu Rap” and is a popular cosplay and fan art subject. The hidden-form concept influenced later “cursed” or “shrouded” Pokémon designs.</p>
