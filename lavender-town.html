      <h2>The Lavender Town Frequency</h2>
      <p><strong>Intro:</strong> This chilling urban legend claims the original Lavender Town theme in Pokémon Red & Green used high-pitched tones that caused physical distress, nightmares, and even psychological harm in young Japanese players.</p>
      <h3>Origins</h3>
      <p>The story began around 1996–1997, when players reported headaches, irritability, and insomnia. Horromodo.com published “evidence” and panic spread via early internet message boards and forums.</p>
      <h3>Debunking & Reality</h3>
      <p>Investigations revealed no official developer evidence. The “creepy” effect was likely due to binaural beats or memory distortion—hardly a toxic soundtrack. Still, the legend endures in creepypasta videos.</p>
      <h3>Fan Theories</h3>
      <p>Some theorists claim a secret sound file was patched out, others argue the effect enhanced Lavender Town Tower’s spooky mood. Though untrue, the tale still inspires fan remixes and remakes.</p>
      <h3>Legacy</h3>
      <p>Today, it lives on in YouTube horror animations, spooky remixes, and cultural references to “the Lavender Town syndrome.”</p>
