    <h2>The Ghost Girl of Lumiose</h2>
    <p><strong>Intro:</strong> A mysterious phantom seen gliding through the Prism Tower in Lumiose City in Pokémon X & Y, leaving players with eerie messages and no explanation.</p>
    <h3>In-Game Sightings</h3>
    <p>Players spot her moving silently across one of the floors with the words “No, you’re not the one...” floating beside her. The scene vanishes quickly, making it a one-off ghostly hint.</p>
    <h3>Fan Guesses</h3>
    <p>Theories range from her being a dimension hologram prototype, an Easter egg for devs, to being connected to Team Flare experiments or an abandoned fairy tale subplot.</p>
    <h3>Mystery & Impact</h3>
    <p>Because she never appears again or is referenced, the encounter became a fan obsession—spawning hidden lore pages, investigation threads, and fan art attempting to decode her message.</p>
